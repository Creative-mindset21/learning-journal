          <p class="content">
            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
            Path, I've made the big jump over to the Boot-camp to get expert
            code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
            peers.

        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>

        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
          was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>

        <h2>How I got started</h2>

        <p>
          I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
          take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
          use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
          short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
        </p>

        <p>
          That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
          my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
          motivated.
